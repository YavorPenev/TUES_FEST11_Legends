                        The first highly appreciated developer we must thank for this endeavour is of course Mr. Yavor Penev.
                        Probably the most organized of the team (which isn't saying too much to be fair), he has been the
                        primary extrinsic motivation for most of the remaining team. As the leading work didtribution
                        manager, he has set upon himself the task of 'careening' the team towards its goals, handing out
                        assignment after assignemt like nobody's business (to much of the less motivated members of the
                        team's dismay). Mr. Penev's work isn't always
                        focused on purely administrative tasks, as he has also highly influenced the final outcome of the
                        main page, most notably the header and footer, ensuring that they are a balsam for any user's eyes.

                    Yet another developer to thank is Mr Kristian Velinov. As the main React developer, it comes to
                        nobody's surprise, that some rather 'niche' (but very neat) functionalities have been lovingly (or
                        angrily at times) crafted for the viewer's sake. Such being the theme changer button, carousel
                        implementation, design and animation, as well as the overall website theme presets and design
                        patters, that have been determined in conjunction with the aforementioned Mr. Penev. Mr Velinov is
                        responsible for the overall webite idea and grand appearance, relating to which we have done our
                        best to work with and keep unchanged throughout the entirety of the project.  These hardships have also almost caused a
                        laptop-sized hole in Mr. Kristian's wall. Our caring developer (ironically proceeding to speak about
                        himself in third person)

                    The third member of the team is Mr. Kristiyan Mihailov. As yet another key developer, he is
                        responsible for everything that is behind an end, or in other words, the backend. Through courage,
                        determination, valor and might, he has been able to learn to fight the vicious menace that is mySQL,
                        Node.js and Express.js - an undertaking that nobody wished to fulfill exept himself! His work has
                        been of paramount importance to the entire project, as his web of work spans from the very extensive
                        database, containing every piece of information that our hardworking previous two members have
                        ensured that it reaches the viewer's eyes, much to their contént. Yet another fruit of his labour
                        are
                        the two 'Profile' and 'Login'/'Signup' pages, gruellingly built up from the ground to serve our
                        users personalized and customizable options to choose from.

                    As the fourth member of the team Mr. bobi77 'Stoynev' is yet another vital cog in the machine that is
                        this project. Despite being the rather inert and busy member, he has managed to spare us a bit of
                        his time to produce some stuff truly magnificent to the eye! The 'stuff' in question being the FAQ
                        (pronounced [Fà-Kíuu]) page, as our thoughts and examinations have led us to believe, that most
                        people don't know how to computer, let alone navigate even our intuitive design and layout. Mr.
                        Stoynev is also responsible for the thorough github description, which explains our project in its
                        core. Bobi77, I failed to mention before, is also in his primary time an expert basketball player,
                        not due to coincidence, but because of the plain fact, that he is also the sole nephew of
                        Vezenkov!!! He is also <b>THE</b> basketballer, who is most frequently chosen by our beloved Mrs.
                        Basheva, which is an achievement in itself.

                    Last but not least comes our equally cherished developer Mr Dein. He is the one responsible for this
                        very page skeleton design, as well as the image insertions. Much like our main team coordinator Mr.
                        Yavor Penev, Mr. Dein is active both frontend and backend, as most dropdown menus have been inserted
                        according to his work. Behind the front, he has also been of assistance to our main backend
                        developer - Mr. Mihailov. Mr. Dein specialises in the languages of node.js and express.js,
                        originating from Mr. Dein's own request to study and learn them. He probably regrets it now. Being
                        yet another talented sportsman, he is a vigorous supporter of Bulgarian football, as he himself has
                        experience in it too. Autographs from 24:10 to 24:15, PMT, Timor Leste.
